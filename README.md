# Login App

I've been learning `node.js` recently as well as `mongoDB`. This is my first project where I'm actually creating a site that lets the user login or register to an actual noSQL database. This is also my first attempt at creating a modern website that goes beyond just having a few files. I'm actually creating a web server and routing along with using `express` and `express-handlebars` the make that all easier.
