# Login App

I've been learning `node.js` recently as well as `mongoDB`. This is my first project where I'm actually creating a site that lets the user login or register to an actual noSQL database. This is also my first attempt at creating a modern website that goes beyond just having a few files. I'm actually creating a web server and routing along with using `express` and `express-handlebars` the make that all easier.

>I added a .gitignore mainly for the dependencies directory. I'm pretty sure this is the accepted way of uploading node projects on git. This means less files to clone and all you need to do is run `npm install` afterwards to get up to date dependencies from the source (with the exception of one specificed module).
